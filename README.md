# ðŸ“™ Notebook

Class content, lecture notes, & materials for the Lincoln School Computer Science Elective (9th & 10th grade).

## Getting Started

In order to access the notebook on your local machine, you must execute the following steps:

**1. Clone the repository using Git**

Copy the SSH key and use it in your command line the following way:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Lincoln-CS-Elective/notebook.git
# then, change into the notebook directory:
cd notebook
```

**2. Launch Jupyter**

Make sure you're in the correct directory and have installed Jupyter Notebook. If you haven't, click [here](https://github.com/Lincoln-CS-Elective/notebook/blob/main/docs/CONDA.md) to view the guide.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage

This is your main access to the curriculum taught through the entire duration of the course. Use it to follow along with lectures, projects, and teachings and prepare for projects/assessments (as well as to test code snippets and learn interactively).

The class notebook runs on [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), an open-source interactive notebook-enhancing software.
