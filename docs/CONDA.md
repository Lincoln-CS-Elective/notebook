# üêç Installing Conda

## Intro

As described by the creators, Conda is a cross-platform, language-agnostic binary package manager. It is the
package manager used by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installations, but it may be
used for other systems as well.  Conda makes environments first-classcitizens, making it easy to create independent environments even for Clibraries. Conda is written entirely in Python, and is BSD licensed open
source.

## Installation

Once you have done so, follow the instructions within the installer and within minutes, it should be installed.

## Getting Started

If you install Anaconda, you will already have hundreds of packages installed. You can see what packages are installed by running

```bash

   $ conda list
  ```

to see all the packages that are available, use

```bash

   $ conda search
```

and to install a package, use

```bash

   $ conda install <package-name>
```

You should be all set! Check out the Anaconda [website](https://www.anaconda.com/) for more information and resources.
